# yarn-workspace-example

Example to demo to show working with yarn workspace (with Vue.js)

From [Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces): 

_Yarn workspaces aim to make working with monorepos easy, solving one of the main use cases for yarn link in a more declarative way. In short, they allow multiple projects to live together in the same repository AND to cross-reference each other - any modification to one's source code being instantly applied to the others._

# BUT 

Just like the long trandition of yarn,  
they have one thing which is very consistent 

- BAD documentation
- Very BAD documentation

And very consistently lie about what works and what's not 

So please stay away from this piece of crap.
